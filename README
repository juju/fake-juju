Fake juju
==========

This package is a fake juju environment/API endpoint (basically a real juju
with a null provider).

Adding a new version
---------------------

1) Edit the Makefile and add the desired version on the very first line.
2) Create a new version subdirectory, copy fake_juju.go there.
3) Make sure there is a corresponding .patch file in the patches/ subdirectory.

Dependencies
------------

To run tests, the code will need a recent python-jujuclient package installed.
One should add the juju-stable PPA to get a fresh enough version on at least
trusty and vivid:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:juju/stable
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-jujuclient

Building
---------

Generally speak, this package is built from a recipe here: https://code.launchpad.net/fake-juju/+recipes

You can build it locally running 'dpkg-buildpackage -b'.
