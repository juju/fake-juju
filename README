Fake juju
==========

This package is a fake juju environment/API endpoint (basically a real juju
with a null provider).

Adding a new version
---------------------

1) Edit the Makefile and add the desired version on the very first line.
2) Create a new version subdirectory, copy fake_juju.go there.
3) Make sure there is a corresponding .patch file in the patches/ subdirectory.

Dependencies
------------

To run tests, the code will need the latest python-jujuclient and python-txjuju
packages installed. These builds are available from the juju-stable and
txjuju-daily PPAs and can be added with:

sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:juju/stable
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:landscape/txjuju-daily
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install python-jujuclient python-txjuju

Building
---------

Generally speaking, this package is built and delivered to PPAs from a recipe here: https://code.launchpad.net/fake-juju/+recipes.

You can build it locally running 'dpkg-buildpackage -b'.
